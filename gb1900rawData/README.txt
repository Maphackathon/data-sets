This is a sub-set of the data we hold from the gb1900 database, it's a bounding box around an area of the Thames specified for the maphackathon.

For the maphackahton we have provided data in github friendly native geojson collections, in CSV with the locations in either EWKT or geojson. 

Here follows the standard readme for our raw data downloads:
