For a government archive the National Archives contains a surprisingly large number of songs.

The 17th century collection includes items seized at sea (ending up in High Court of Admiralty files) and seditious ballads
seized by the government. These are often supportive of Jacobites, insult the crown or demand rights for British subjects. Some of these ballads name their tunes, making it clear what they sounded like.

Some of these tunes are old folk tunes:

The Honest Jury (SP 36/16/156, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C8107046) celebrating freedom of the press is to be sung to the tune of Packington's Pound, a tune then nearing its 150th birthday. Can be heard in several versions on YouTube including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhtBWour9nI

'As Soon as the Wind' (SP 35/24/82, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C15389421) "a satirical dialogue between George I and the Duchess of Kendal about the composition of the council of regency" is to be performed to the tune known as King John and the Abbot of Canterbury. The ballad can be heard in this setting at http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/32823/recording or in a more spirited version (with different words) at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NGpieMMCsQ
