WORK 38/331 from the National Archives

http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C2029722

Jonas Moore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Moore) had already completed a map of the "great levell of the Fens" for a private
consortium, before being hired by the government in 1662 to represent the Thames basin.

The illustrations on the map are (likely) by Wenceslaus Holler.

Copies of the map, produced in 1912, may be found in several other collections. The original was first used by the Navy Board.
It was subsequently kept by the Office of Works, probably on display, leading to the light damage it has suffered.

I have included a set of the inset views of London as separate files. The last file is the full map. I looked at a big TIFF but it didn't unfortunately offer better resolution.

If you are interested in collections metadata at scale, the National Archives API provides an endpoint to UK wide archival records data. Details on how to use it (a key is not required) can be found at:
