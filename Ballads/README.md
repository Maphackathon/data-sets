For a government archive the National Archives contains a surprisingly large number of songs.

The 17th century collection includes items seized at sea (ending up in High Court of Admiralty files) and seditious ballads
seized by the government. These are often supportive of Jacobites, insult the crown or demand rights for British subjects. Some of these ballads name their tunes, making it clear what they sounded like.

Some of these tunes are old folk tunes:

The Honest Jury (SP 36/16/156, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C8107046) celebrating freedom of the press is to be sung to the tune of Packington's Pound, a tune then nearing its 150th birthday. Packington's Pound can be heard in several versions on YouTube including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhtBWour9nI

'As Soon as the Wind' (SP 35/24/82, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C15389421) "a satirical dialogue between George I and the Duchess of Kendal about the composition of the council of regency" is to be performed to the tune known as King John and the Abbot of Canterbury. The ballad can be heard in this setting at http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/32823/recording or in a more spirited/tuneful version (with different words) at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NGpieMMCsQ.

Sue Wellfleat's Bargain (C 107/104, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7028706) a saucy ballad about a fishwife taking umbrage at a Frenchman. The tune is not named but it contains the same 'down derry down' refrain so may have been sung to the same tune. I have transcribed the manuscript.

The Difficult Batchelor (HCA 32/160/18, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14514131) is also a little racy but once again it is the woman who has, very firmly, the upper hand. This one was definitely owned by a sailor and is strangely hummable even without a tune. The first three lines presumably solo and then on the fourth line everyone joins in.

The Shepherd's Holiday (SP 35/22/62, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C15389119) is an innocent seeming ballad to the singer's "dearest dear" but the government seemed to believe this was James Stuart, son of James II. The ballad unwisely states it was printed "printed for Flora, at the sign of Aurora, in Turn-again Lane", allowing this alleged den of Catholic sympathy to be georeferenced.
