Gabor Bakos has created a useful tool in leaflet with a series of map layers
The frame is the geographic area of London Bridge to Woolwich
There are currently twelvemaps in the tool, ranging from 1682 to 1896
Most of the maps are tiled using the lower end version of Klokan Technologies' MapTiler (hence you will see watermarks]
