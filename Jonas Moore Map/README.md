WORK 38/331 from the National Archives

http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C2029722

Jonas Moore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Moore) had already completed a map of the "great levell of the Fens" for a private
consortium, before being hired by the government in 1662 to represent the Thames basin.

The illustrations on the map are (likely) by Wenceslaus Holler.

Copies of the map, produced in 1912, may be found in several other collections. The original was first used by the Navy Board.
It was subsequently kept by the Office of Works, probably on display, leading to the light damage it has suffered.
