For a government archive the National Archives contains a surprisingly large number of songs.

The 17th century collection includes items seized at sea (ending up in High Court of Admiralty files) and seditious ballads
seized by the government. These are often supportive of Jacobites, insult the crown or demand rights for British subjects.

Some of these ballads name their tunes, making it clear what they sounded like.
