OS MAPS API

EM from Rollo Home, OS, to Colin Greenstreet, dated 07/02/2017

Colin,
 
Apologies in the delay in responding (I've been out of the office).
 
Please find attached the Hackathon supplementary information sheet for all users when they register along with the API key (which is below). This contains details of the Ts&Cs (Data Exploration Terms), the period the API key is available for (7 days after the events) and how to obtain their own account/key beyond that.
 
The API Key to be used by all attendees is: ozFhdmYsGg2gZTQmhtrG6Bbmykf7YGmn
This will be active for 7 days after the event to enable the users to register for their own trials for further use.
 
Technical documentation is available here: https://apidocs.os.uk/docs/os-maps-overview. If there are any issues before the w/e let me know asap so that I can resolve things – I’ve not been able to secure any resource to cover the w/e itself unfortunately.
 
Regards
